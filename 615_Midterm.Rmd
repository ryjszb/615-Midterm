## County-level oil and gas production

```{r}
oilgascounty <- read.csv("C:/Users/ccren/Desktop/615mid/615mid/oilgascounty.csv")
```

### 1. Data summary and introduction
#### (a). Summary 
```{r}
dim(oilgascounty)
head(oilgascounty)
colSums(is.na(oilgascounty)) #  check for whole cols filled with NA - variables without data
summary(oilgascounty)
```
#### (b). Introduction the meanings of variables
State oil and gas production statistics were used to create a database of annual county-level production for 2000 through 2011. Data are available for onshore production in the lower 48 States only. Raw data for natural gas is for gross withdrawals, and oil data include natural gas liquids except for Colorado where the State reported them as natural gas withdrawals. Note that State-reported natural gas withdrawals were not available for Illinois or Indiana; these estimates were produced using geocoded wells and State total production reported by the EIA.

Using this method, 920 counties in 31 States are identified with some natural gas production occurring (in 2011), and 980 counties in 30 States are identified with some onshore oil production (in 2011), see the maps below.

Counties with increases or decreases in excess of $20 million in oil and/or natural gas production during 2000-11 are also identified (see map). To convert amounts to values, ERS researchers took annual national prices for oil (EIA first-purchase price) and gas (EIA wellhead price) for 2000 and 2011, converted them to 2011 dollars, and then took the average over the period. This method yields a natural gas price of $5.80 per 1,000 cubic foot (Mcf) and an oil price of $57.90 per barrel, which is then applied to the county-level change in production over the 2000-11 period. Counties with $20 million or more gain/decline in the value of production are thus identified.

### 2.Clean the data
#### (a). Natural gas and oil production in the lower 48 states, by metropolitan status, 2000-2011
```{r}
# gas production
gas <- subset(oilgascounty,select = c(County_Name,Metro_Micro_Noncore_2013,
 Stabr,gas2000:gas2011,gas_change_group))
```

```{r}
# oil production
oil <- subset(oilgascounty,select = c(County_Name, Stabr,Metro_Micro_Noncore_2013,

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

gas$year<-substr(gas$year,4,7)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

head(stabroil)
#total gas indifferent state and different year

### 3.Plot

#### From 2000 to 2011, onshore gross withdrawals of natural gas in the lower 48 States increased by about 47 percent, reaching historic highs in every year after 2006. Over the same period, withdrawals of oil increased by 11 percent, with much of that growth occurring between 2007 and 2011. Rural counties (nonmetro noncore) accounted for almost all of the growth in oil production and a large share of the growth in gas production. For natural gas, several metropolitan areas¡ªnotably the Fort Worth area in Texas¡ªalso contributed to the growth in production. County-level indicators of the degree of rurality are included in the data file.
```{r}
